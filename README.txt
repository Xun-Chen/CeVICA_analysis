1. System requirements
Requires python version 3.7 or newer (https://www.python.org/), Operating System: Windows/Linux/UNIX/Mac OS.
Code was tested with python 3.7 on Windows 10.
Public python packages required were noted at the begining of code and can be installed using standard python package installation methods (https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/).
The following required external data are provided: Amino_Acids_Similarity_Matrix.xlsx, CDR_Boundries.xlsx, codon_table.xlsx, quality_score.xlsx.

2. Installation guide
The scripts require no installation and can be executed through standard command-line interface such as Microsoft Windows Command Prompt, see above for installing dependencies.

3. Demo Instructions
Demo data generated by illumina MiSeq platform can be downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (Accession #: PRJNA756264): SR3_read1.fastq, SR3_read1.fastq, GP3_read1.fastq, GP3_read1.fastq, STR_read1.fastq, STR_read1.fastq

4. Instructions for use
The analysis process is separated into five modules and each module is completed by a custom script listed below.
To set correct input path for each script, locate the note within the script " Input path, change accordingly " and change the input path in the specified line below.
Run the scripts in numerical order, the outputs of a previous script are used as input for the next script.

CeVICA_analysis1.py 
CeVICA_analysis2.py
CeVICA_analysis3.py
CeVICA_analysis4.py
CeVICA_analysis5.py

Estimated time to complete the analysis on a standard desktop computer is 1 hour
